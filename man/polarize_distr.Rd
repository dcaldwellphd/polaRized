\arguments{
\item{data}{A data set object}

\item{value}{A column containing values on some variable or set of variables, such as attitude item responses.}

\item{measure}{A string specifying the measure of distributional polarization. See Details below.}

\item{by}{A character vector of optional groups to nest observations by (e.g., survey wave, country, social group).}

\item{rescale_0_1}{Logical. Setting to TRUE normalizes values prior to summarizing their distribution.}

\item{ids}{Variables specifying cluster ids from largest level to smallest level (leaving the argument empty, NULL, 1, or 0 indicate no clusters).}

\item{probs}{Variables specifying cluster sampling probabilities.}

\item{strata}{Variables specifying strata.}

\item{fpc}{Variables specifying a finite population correct, see
\code{\link[survey]{svydesign}} for more details.}

\item{nest}{If \code{TRUE}, relabel cluster ids to enforce nesting within strata.}

\item{check_strata}{If \code{TRUE}, check that clusters are nested in strata.}

\item{weights}{Variables specifying weights (inverse of probability).}

\item{pps}{"brewer" to use Brewer's approximation for PPS sampling without replacement. "overton" to use Overton's approximation. An object of class HR to use the Hartley-Rao approximation. An object of class ppsmat to use the Horvitz-Thompson estimator.}

\item{variance}{For pps without replacement, use variance="YG" for the Yates-Grundy estimator instead of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator.}

\value{
A data frame object containing the distributional measure applied to \code{value} for any groups in \code{by}.

\description{
Calculates distributional measures of polarization
}
\details{
This function is a one-stop-shop for distributional measures of polarization. It is designed around the \code{survey} package, allowing for the incorporation of complex survey design features. It is useful when you want to summarise a large number of attitude distributions at once. This was previously less convenient, as the \code{survey} package requires the user to specify variables manually. Pass columns containing grouping information (such as variable names) to the \code{by} argument, and \code{polarize_distr} will automatically nest the data and apply functions related to the \code{survey} package.

The latter is set by the \code{measure} argument, which currently accepts the following values:
\itemize{
 \item \code{"mean"}: Mean of the distribution, using \code{survey::svymean}
 \item \code{"median"}: Median of the distribution, using \code{survey::svyquantile}
\item \code{"iqr"}: Interquartile range of the distribution, using \code{survey::svyquantile}
\item \code{"var"}: Variance of the distribution, using \code{survey::svyvar}
\item \code{"std"}: Standard deviation of the distribution, using \code{jtools::svysd}, which is a wrapper around \code{survey::svyvar}
\item \code{"kurt"}: Kurtosis of the distribution, using the \code{svykurt} function implemented in this package
\item \code{"skew"}: Skewness of the distribution, using the \code{svyskew} function implemented in this package
\item \code{"extremism"}: Proportion of respondents who are extreme on the distribution, using the \code{svyextremism} function implemented in this package.
\item And these methods for estimating consensus and disagreement on ordered rating scales from the \code{agrmt} package, each of which are run on frequency vectors created using \code{survey::svytable}: \code{"agreement"}, \code{"polarization"}, \code{"Leik"}, \code{"consensus"}, \code{"entropy"}, \code{"BerryMielke"}, \code{"BlairLacy"}, \code{"Kvalseth"}, \code{"lsquared"}, \code{"dsquared"}, \code{"MRQ"}, \code{"concentration"}, \code{"dispersion"}, and \code{"Reardon"}. See \code{\link[agrmt]{agreement}} for more details.}
