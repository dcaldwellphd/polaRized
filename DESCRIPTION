Description: A one-stop-shop for measures of attitude polarization
  commonly used in the political science literature. It makes it
  easy to summarize distributional and associational properties among 
  potentially large numbers of attitude items in complex survey data.
  The package also provides useful functions for incorporating survey
  design features into the estimation of key statistics, such as
  skewness and kurtosis.
